LA-SiGMA, the Louisiana Alliance for Simulation-Guided Materials
Applications, is a statewide interdisciplinary collaboration of
material and computer scientists developing computational resources
tuned for the latest generation of accelerator-equipped systems. The
Alliance also develops graduate curricula and is engaged in multiple
outreach activities. Visit us at http://lasigma.loni.org .

The accelerator ports of this code were developed by Ye Fang, Sheng Feng, 
Ka-Ming Tam, Zhifeng Yun, Juana Moreno, J. Ramanujam, Mark Jarrell.
